## This set covers some practical and industrial projects, cooperated with Broad Institute, SquarkAI etc.
## Professor: Nicholas Brown

#### 1. The foundations of data processing & visualization:
#### 2. Applied visualization in field of transportation, biology(dendrogram).
* e.g.: Project: Predict how the weather affects the traffic: Is there any direct relationship between them?  
#### 2. The foundation of Tensorflow: 
#### 3. Deep learning model:   
#### 4. Projects:  
* Prediction & Visualization by GEOSPACIAL & WEATHER data For Uber Drivers (Spatial data + Sentiment analytics)  
* Analysis & Predict trip duration of taxi Based on Climate & Geospatial visualization.(FLARE)
* CIFAR-10 dataset model training & Network argument testing & Comparison:  the activation functions, lost functions, gradient estimations etc.
* Retail data analytics:  Retail data processing & visualization in kinds of plots and explore the correlations betweens some attributes, like temperature VS fuel_price etc.
* Biology simulation:  
  - Genome dendrogram;
  - Variance simulation etc.
