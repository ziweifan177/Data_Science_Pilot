    "- Using local surrogate models based interpretability algorithms such as LIME on image data work by creating interpretable model-agnostic explanations by first segmenting with image processing algorithms such as slic, watershed, chan_vese, etc. (see https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.segmentation.html)  \n",
    "- The problem with this kind of image segmentation from a model interpretability standpoint is that even when important predictive features of images are identified they are not mapped to any semantic meaning.   \n",
    "- In the example below the local surrogate model interpretability LIME, using slic to segment the image, identifies the red regions as important for a making prediction of an astronaut or not.  Unfortunately those regions have no semantic meaning. They may be part of the helmet, or the space suit but what one really wants to know is which semantic features are important.   \n",

    "- Semantic segmentation is unlike classification where the end result of the very deep network is the only important thing, not only requires <font color='red'>discrimination at pixel level</font> but also a mechanism to <font color='red'>project the discriminative features</font> learnt at different stages of the encoder onto the pixel space.  \n",

    "The encoder is usually is a pre-trained classification network like VGG/ResNet followed by a decoder network.  \n",
    "The task of the decoder is to semantically project the discriminative features (lower resolution) learnt by the encoder onto the pixel space (higher resolution) to get a dense classification."
