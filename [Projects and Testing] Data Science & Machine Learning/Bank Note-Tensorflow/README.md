This project focused on the tensorflow.estimator.

The data consists of 5 columns, where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic:

- variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  
- skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  
- curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  
- entropy of image (continuous)  
- class (integer): [Target] indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

## Another Point:##
- Compare the different parameters to check how the parameter affects the accuracy:
a. Train test split
b. Classifier: Hidden_layer
c. Classifier: Batch_size
d. Classifier: Train Steps
