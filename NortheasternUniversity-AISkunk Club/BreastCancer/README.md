This dataset is to interpret the model for predicting the probablity 'Diagnosis' of breast cancer based on features.

### The approaches for interpretability:
1. Variable importance plot;
2. Partial dependence plot;
3. LIME


Please notice the LIME plot could not display in github, please feel free direct to here for further checking.
